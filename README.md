Soccer Training Technology

The Soccer Training Technology is a unique project to revolutionize soccer training with the help of technology. 
The Project goal is to be a part of the technological advancement in soccer with the hope that it will act 
as a catalyst in the technological development in the overall sports area. STT’s main objective is to analyze, store, 
and compare assessments from different users. Not stopping there, STT’s goal is to be able to also make more meaningful
personalized data for individuals based on their performance on different tries of the same assessment over time; 
1. are their numbers better? 
2. How fast is their improvement in comparison to others? 
3. What is their current ranking / ratings? 

STT is developed to be a very good tool to improve any aspects of soccer STT can provide 
(developing more assessments that assess different aspects of soccer; touch, dribble, decision making, accuracy, pace, distance, etc). 


Considering the complexity of the project, STT was started on the minimum viable product, Beta. 
Beta is a soccer training framework that is purposely designed for development and further integration. 
Currently, Beta has reached its prototype stage where it could detect users during assessments, process the data, 
and then generate transcripts that will be sent to the server. The framework is based on the Python programming 
language and uses Ubuntu 20.04. Take note that CUDA is needed to run the prototype using the GPU. 

What is Beta 

Beta is a framework that processes everything needed from checking camera feed, area calibration, 
object detection, pose estimation, processing real time data, generating transcript and eventually 
to send processed data to the server.
